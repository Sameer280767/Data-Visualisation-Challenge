Analysis
248 mice were analysed (records for one mouse was deleted as part of data cleansing)
Of the 243 mice 123 were females and 125 males
10 types of drugs were administered to the mice in 5 day intervals till 45 days
During this time the volume of tumour size in mm3 was measured for each mice
Average age and weight of mice were recorded for the period
Analyis of 4 types of drugs namely Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin tells the following story a) Maximum tumour size was oserved for Infubinol, with data evenly distributed (mean almost equal to median) however data spread was high with std of 6.6 b) Capomulin and Ramicane showed lowest tumour volume after 45 days at 34.96 and 36.24 respectively c) The above 2 drugs had the least std of less than 5
For Capomulin average tumour size for mouse b128 showed a decreasing trend from 0 to 45 days with an increase manifesting on day 45
For the population of all mice however, average tumour size has fallen over 45 days for Capomlin
For mice on Capomulin regime, corelation between tumour size and weight was strong. Heavier the mice, greater the tumour volume
Of the 10 drugs, Ramicane and Capomulin are the only 2 drug that have led to average tumour size reducing in mice over 45 days
Further scope of testing

Based on above, further analysis is suggested for these 2 drugs to understand how the sex, age and weight of the mice together contribute to growth of tumour
Ramicane and Capomulin are recommended to be carried forward for further testing
